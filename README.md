# Reverse
CS50 project, 2015

This is a project done for the [CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), one of the most famous online courses on [edX](https://www.edx.org/) platform.

I am not going to explain how the course is structured in details (you can look for them through the link above), but the essence is that you have 9 problem sets (*programming assignments*, about C, PHP, Javascript, SQL, CSS, HTML) during the course and one final project, whose nature is entirely up to you.
**Reverse** is my final project.

### What Reverse is
When I had to think about what to create I was completely without ideas. After a few days it suddenly came up in my mind an old game I usually did when I was child: take a word and try to "reverse" it in mind. With reverse I mean managing to pronounce it spelled backward.
Then... I just transformed that game in my project.

I think there is space for a lot of improvement: I developed Reverse in less than two weeks, while attending my university. Moreover at that time I had no experience at all.

Maybe in the future I'll work again on this project.
